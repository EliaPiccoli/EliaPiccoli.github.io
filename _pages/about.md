Elia Piccoli is a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Pisa, supervised by [Davide Bacciu](http://pages.di.unipi.it/bacciu/) and [Vincenzo Lomonaco](https://www.vincenzolomonaco.com/). He is a member of the _Computational Intelligence and Machine Learning_ ([_CIML_](https://ciml.di.unipi.it/)) group and _Pervasive AI Lab_ ([_PAILab_](http://pai.di.unipi.it/)). Furthermore, Elia is part of the _Driverless Division_ at [_E-Team Squadra Corse_](https://www.eteamsquadracorse.it/) working as advisor on the autonomous driving race car development via Reinforcement Learning.

His research interests focus on _Reinforcement Learning_, _Lifelong Learning_ and _compositionality_. In particular, his current work is concerned on studying methodologies to combine and leverage pre-trained representations and models to expand Reinforcement Learning agents' prior knowledge. At the same time, Elia is supervising several thesis, related to his research project, deepening different themes related to compositionality and representation learning for policies and tasks in lifelong scenarios.
