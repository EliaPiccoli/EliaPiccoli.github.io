Elia Piccoli is a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Pisa, supervised by [Davide Bacciu](http://pages.di.unipi.it/bacciu/) and [Vincenzo Lomonaco](https://www.vincenzolomonaco.com/). He is a member of the _Computational Intelligence and Machine Learning_ ([_CIML_](https://ciml.di.unipi.it/)) group and _Pervasive AI Lab_ ([_PAILab_](http://pai.di.unipi.it/)). Furthermore, Elia is part of the _Driverless Division_ at [_E-Team Squadra Corse_](https://www.eteamsquadracorse.it/) working on the autonomous driving race car.

His research interests focus on _Reinforcement Learning_, _Continual Learning_ and _Self-Supervised_ approaches. In particular, his current work is concerned with studying novel approaches to create agents that can learn to solve multiple tasks at the same time, e.g., play different Atari games, with a particular interest in how to represent different abilities and previous knowledge that can be exploited while learning and solving new tasks through time.
